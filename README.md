# Computational Methods

This repository contains materials and code related to computational methods in science and engineering. It comprises codes developed during laboratory exercises aimed at exploring various methods, comparing them, and conducting thorough investigations.

## Contents

1. **Error analysis**: Approximating derivatives and solving recurrence equations, followed by graphical analysis of the obtained results
2. **Least squares method**: Applying the method of least squares to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign
3. **Interpolation**: Polynomial interpolation on a dataset concerning the population of the USA from 1900 to 1980 using various sets of basis functions.
4. **Runge's phenomenon**: Determine interpolating polynomials for the given functions and anylysis of the Runge phenomenon.
5. **Aproximation**: Pointwise least squares approximation of the population of the United States
6. **Quadratures**: Approximation of the value of π through numerical integration using composite rectangular, trapezoidal, Simpson's, and Gauss-Legendre quadrature methods.
7. **Adaptive quadratures**: Compute the given definite integrals using the following quadrature methods: rectangle, trapezoidal, Simpson's, Gauss-Legendre, adaptive trapezoidal, and adaptive Gauss-Kronrod.
8. **Solving nonlinear equations**: Convergence analysis and implementation of various iterative schemes for root-finding, alongside Newton's method iteration schemes for both single and system nonlinear equations.
9. **Ordinary differential equations**: Representing ordinary differential equations as systems of first-order equations, solving them analytically with stability assessment, and numerically solving them using explicit and implicit Euler methods, along with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.
10. **Partial differential equations**: Using Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINN) with a 4-neuron input layer to solve the boundary value problem described by the two-dimensional Schrödinger equation in an infinite potential well, subject to given boundary conditions, for various quantum numbers (n1,n2), aiming to minimize the cost function and visualize the contour plot of the exact solution ψ(x,y).
11. **Optimization**: Finding the minimum of the Rosenbrock function using the steepest descent and Newton's methods of optimization, testing them with given initial points, and comparing the results after 10 iterations, observing if the methods behave as expected.
